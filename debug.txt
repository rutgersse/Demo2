We have utilized 2 main debugging tools that do not come standard to 
python. 
(1) pdb 
	we utilize this tool by setting traces throughout the program
	to understand any errors that occured.
	After following the stack trace it allows us to quickly find the
	bug/error in our program
	We set breakpoints and single stepping at the source line level, 
	inspection of stack frames, source code listing, and evaluation of
	arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame

(2) Django Debug Toolbar
	Is a nother tool that does not come standard but we found that 
	it helps with understanding why our pages report errors. The common
	response that we find are detailed response/request when clicking
	though the website
